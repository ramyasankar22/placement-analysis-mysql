## SQL Concepts
This project demonstrates the following key SQL concepts:

- **Triggers:** Automatically check if a student's CGPA meets a company's minimum CGPA before insertion into the PLACEMENTS table.  
- **WHERE Clauses:** Filter students based on branch and CGPA eligibility.  
- **Views:** Predefined views such as `Eligible_Students` to show students eligible for placement in each company.
